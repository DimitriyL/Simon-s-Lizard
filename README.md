# Simon's-Lizard

###### _**Repository for the APCS1 final project by Dimitriy Leksanov, Kelly Wang and Maggie Xia.**_
 
### Description

As Google Play says:

> Get ready to soil your plants as a mob of fun-loving zombies is about to invade your home. Use your arsenal of many zombie-zapping plants — peashooters, wall-nuts, cherry bombs and more — to mulchify multiple types of zombies before they break down your door. 

Use terminal interactions to place plants on an 8 x 8 board represented by an array. Zombies will be placed automatically. Every character will be represented by a letter or symbol, and bullets will be represented by dashes. Every character has health and suns are used to purchase more plants.
